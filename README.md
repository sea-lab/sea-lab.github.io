## Base

As you can see this repository is forked off jasper2 template project, you can find more details about changing the template there.

## Maintainance

### Updating the people page
Make changes to `_data/authors.yml`. You can mark people that are graduated with `current: False`, you can have `bio` and `long_bio`, and acceptable values for `section` are   


```
  faculty
  postdoc
  phd
  masters
  undergrad
```


If you enter other values they won't show up on people page (silently, with no errors).

### Updating the website
Number of builds (published updates) per day is limited, so try to test and check your changes before publishing locally first. To try the site on your machine use `bundle exec jekyll serve`.


### Updating styleseets
This is a bit tricky. Jasper2 styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally. This is not a part of jekyll compilation pipeline and should be done manually. After the installation, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.


### Publishing changes
Just `push` your changes, Travis CI will build and publish changes. Since the number of builds per day is limited, to not hit the limit you can use some simple tricks. You can have multiple commits locally and push them all at once. Or better, you can use branches properly instead of pushing everything on master. Pushing on other branches won't trigger the deployment pipeline.
