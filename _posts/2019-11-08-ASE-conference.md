Our lab's latest journal paper, [Interactive Semi-automated SpecificationMining for Debugging: An Experience Report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02245.pdf), is accepted to be presented at journal first conference second track of ASE conference. 

In that reserach project in close collaboration with our industry partner, we developed a novel debugging method using latest specification mining methods. The developers in the company found this method (and the tool developed along with it) a valuable asset and a useful asset in their toolbox.

I am looking forward to see you all in the conference and have some chat about it.
