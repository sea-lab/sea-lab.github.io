  link: /papers/2020-Hybrid.pdf
  abstract: Inferring behavior model of a running software system is quite useful for several automated software engineering tasks, such as program comprehension, anomaly detection, and testing. Most existing dynamic model inference techniques are white-box, i.e., they require source code to be instrumented to get run-time traces. However, in many systems, instrumenting the entire source code is not possible (e.g. when using black-box third-party libraries) or might be very costly. Unfortunately, most black-box techniques that detect states over time are either univariate, or make assumptions on the data distribution, or have limited power for learning over a long period of past behavior. To overcome the above issues, in this paper, we propose a hybrid deep neural network that accepts as input a set of time series, one per input/output signal of the system, and applies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear correlations between signals and the patterns, over time. We have applied our approach on a real UAV auto-pilot solution from our industry partner with half a million lines of C code. We ran 888 random recent system-level test cases and inferred states, over time. Our comparison with several traditional time series change point detection techniques showed that our approach improves their performance by up to 102%, in terms of finding state change points, measured by F1 score. We also showed that our state classification algorithm provides on average 90.45% F1 score, which improves traditional classification algorithms by up to 17%.

    link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245817300566
    abstract: With the increasing size of software systems and the continuous changes that are committed to the software's codebase, regression testing has become very expensive for real-world software applications. Test case prioritization is a classic solution in this context. Test case prioritization is the process of ranking existing test cases for execution with the goal of finding defects sooner. It is useful when the testing budget is limited and one needs to limit their test execution cost, by only running top n test cases, according to the testing budget. There are many heuristics and algorithms to rank test cases. In this chapter, we will see some of the most common test case prioritization techniques from software testing literature as well as trends and advances in this domain.

    abstract: Dynamic model inference techniques have been the center of many research projects recently. There are now multiple open source implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms, which provide basic abstraction and merging capabilities. Most of these tools and algorithms have been developed with one particular application in mind, which is program comprehension. The outputs models can abstract away the details of the program and represent the software behavior in a concise and easy to understand form. However, one application context that is less studied is using such inferred models for debugging, where the behavior to abstract is a faulty behavior (eg, a set of execution traces including a failed test case). We tried to apply some of the existing model inference techniques (implemented in a promising tool called MINT) in a real-world industrial context to support program comprehension for debugging. Our initial experiments have shown many limitations both in terms of implementation as well as the algorithms. The paper will discuss the root cause of the failures and proposes ideas for future improvement.
